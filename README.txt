!!!----  Food Cost Menu Calculator  ---!!!

Story about myself:
    In (I believe) February 2022 i found the Youtuber Internet Made Coder?? Who was talking about the CS50 course in his video. 


What is the goal of this project?
    I'm working a full time job in a restaurant called 'Big Belly's' and i want to automate the process of calculating the best sell price for our menu items. 

    We have different suppliers, and the biggest one is 'Sligo'. This is our main supplier with a good website where all the prices are up to date. My goal is to make weekly summary's of wich products change in price. So i can proactivly change our prices on the menu
